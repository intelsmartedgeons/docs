# Reference Implementations
Intel has created several example solutions to serve as reference implementations (RIs) on the Intel® Smart Edge infrastructure. These RIs address identified use cases for an edge cloud infrastructure, in different industry segments. Application developers in ISV or end-user organizations can install and study these RIs, and use them as a base for applications they can develop to address user needs

A set of RIs have been created and hosted in a “Smart Edge Open” section in the [Intel Developer Catalog](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-catalog/overview.html?s=Newest&q=%22smart%20edge%20open%22).

They are:
- [Wireless Network-Ready Intelligent Traffic Management](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/reference-implementation/wireless-network-ready-intelligent-traffic-management.html) this RI is designed to detect and track vehicles and pedestrians and provides intelligence required to estimate a safety metric for an intersection. The goal is to use the collected intelligence to adjust traffic lights and optimize traffic flow at an intersection
